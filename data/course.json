SERC brings together cross-disciplinary teams of faculty, researchers, and students to develop original pedagogical materials that meet our goal of training students to practice responsible technology development through incorporation of insights and methods from the humanities and social sciences, including an emphasis on social responsibility.\n\nMaterials include the [MIT Case Studies Series in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/), original Active Learning Projects, and lecture materials that provide students hands-on practice and training in SERC, together with other resources and tools found useful in education at MIT. Original homework assignments and in-class demonstrations are specially created by multidisciplinary teams, to enable instructors to embed SERC-related material into a wide variety of existing courses.\n\nThe aim of SERC is to facilitate the development of responsible \u201chabits of mind and action\u201d for those who create and deploy computing technologies, and fostering the creation of technologies in the public interest.\n",
