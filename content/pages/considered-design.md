These cards are a resource for "considered design." 

The activities they contain are designed to subvert expectations and elicit conversation regarding the social and ethical responsibilities associated with design. They are organized into five categories: inputs, processes, outputs, feedback loops, and ecosystems, each of which focuses on a different part of the design or product lifecycle. When considered as a whole, these cards are intended to demonstrate to the user how social and ethical considerations permeate every stage of a product or system’s design and use. 

These cards are intended to help foster in users a creative and flexible approach to the potential impacts of a design process, rather than treating any such outcomes or impacts as a formulaic "check-box" aspect of design. Indeed, flexibility is built into the very nature of the cards themselves—these cards can be used in a variety of settings, and while the cards may have specific time and material requirements listed, they can often be adapted and "remixed" to suit specific learning environments and contexts.

The goal is for these cards to become a collaborative resource—we’re looking forward to people submitting their own activities for standalone cards or submitting "remixes" whereby existing activities can be used in new and innovative ways. This is a living resource—we can’t wait to see how it grows with time and use!
