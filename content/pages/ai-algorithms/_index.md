*Authors:* Leslie Kaelbling, Serena Booth, Marion Boulicault, Dheekshita Kumar, Rodrigo Ochigame, Tess Smidt

This course introduces principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction; formulation of learning problems; representation, over-fitting, generalization; classification, regression, reinforcement-learning, sequence learning, clustering; classical and neural-network methods.

The course has weekly labs, in which students work in pairs and have an opportunity to discuss their work with an instructor during a check-off process. Each weekly lab has an accompanying SERC question and discussion prompt. These SERC questions aim to help the students connect the technical content of the class to the social consequences of seemingly-technical design decisions. 

*Weekly Labs:* weekly labs, each with a SERC question and discussion prompt

*Keywords:* machine learning; bias and fairness in machine learning; data bias; model bias

*Authors:* Jacob Andreas, Catherine D'Ignazio, Harini Suresh

*Assignment:* "Dataset Creation"

*Keywords:* data annotation; natural language processing; machine learning; content moderation

*Topics addressed:*

- Critical assessment of how and by whom a given dataset was created
- What its limitations might be
- What the data should and should not be used for

*Author:* Rob Miller, Abby Jaques

*Lecture Module:* “Moral Lenses Case Study” 

*Keywords:* Software Construction

*Module Goals:* A reading and class activity to explore the implications of a proposed change to change the ranking algorithm for posts on a social media site, and examine:

- What are the main benefits it will or may provide, and to whom?
- What are the main harms it will or may cause, and to whom?
- How could you maximize the benefits and minimize the harms, and ensure that they are distributed fairly?
